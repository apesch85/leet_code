In the introduction, we have gone through the concept of a tree and a binary tree.

In this chapter, we will focus on the traversal methods used in a binary tree. Understanding these traversal methods will definitely help you have a better understanding of the tree structure and have a solid foundation for the further study.

The goal of this chapter is to:

1. Understand the difference between different tree traversal methods.
2. Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal recursively.
3. Be able to solve preorder, inorder and postorder traversal iteratively.
4. Be able to do level traversal using BFS.
